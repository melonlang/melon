melon - is a programming language designed specifically for datapack development that compiles source code directly to datapacks. melon strives to improve datapack development experience in many ways. it is written in go, and it will have go-like syntax. melon takes big inspiration from other programming languages designed for developing datapacks, like jmc, mcbuild, and bolt.

# why use melon over vanilla mcfunction?

- avoid hard coding and repetitive routine work

# FAQ

## are melon-based datapacks optimized?

the optimization of your datapack when coding in melon directly depends in your coding skills. your code will be as optimized as it would've been if you coded in vanilla mcfunction. however, melon provides tools to make optimization easier, so if anything, it could only improve optimization, never decrease.

## is melon safe?

yes, melon is absolutely safe. why would i upload malware on github? you can read through all of the source code or test melon via virustotal
