# what is melon

melon - is a programming language designed specifically for datapack development that compiles source code directly to datapacks. melon strives to improve datapack development experience in many ways. it is written in go, and it will have go-like syntax. melon takes big inspiration from other programming languages designed for developing datapacks, like jmc, mcbuild, and bolt.

# why use melon over vanilla mcfunction?

- avoid hard coding and repetitive routine work
- improve readability
- make more optimized code with less effort
- make debugging process easier
- boost development productivity
- proper libraries support
- allows to focus on logic rather than the implementation
- make datapacks more high-level

## get started

you can find all of the resources and documentation on the [wiki](https://github.com/melonlang/melon/wiki)

# FAQ

## is melon going to ruin datapack performance by generating unoptimized code?

the performance of datapack written in melon directly depends on your coding skills. it will run just as efficiently as if you had coded it in pure mcfunction. but hey, melon also provides tools and abstractions to make optimization easier, so it can potentially improve performance, not hinder it.

## is melon safe?

melon's totally safe. it's open source, so you can check the code yourself or scan it with virustotal if you're worried. why would i risk uploading malware on github?
