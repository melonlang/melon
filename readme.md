# what is melon

melon - is a programming language designed specifically for datapack development that compiles source code directly to datapacks. melon strives to improve datapack development experience, specifically:

- avoid hard coding and repetitive routine work (boilerplate)
- improve readability
- make more optimized code with less effort
- make debugging process easier
- improve productivity
- make and use proper libraries
- allow you to focus on logic rather than the implementation
- make datapacks more high-level

melon is going be written in go, and it will also have a more go-like syntax. it takes big inspiration from similar programming languages, like jmc, bolt, mcbuild.
